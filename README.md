# Flatbuffer Schemas

More information on [flatbuffers as IDL](https://adsharma.github.io/flattools/). In order to strengthen this claim, I'm putting together a bunch of useful schemas that are ready to use.

Included in this repo:

* Activity Streams 2.0
* Telegram API and TDLib API
* Raft consensus algorithm

These data structures were described using other languages - typically grpc, JSONLD/RDF or Telegram's TL (type language). Subjectively, you might prefer the easier to grok syntax of this IDL.
